## The Sliding Window Rate Limiter is a rate limiting algorithm that allows a specified number of requests to be processed within a fixed time window. Unlike the Fixed Window Rate Limiter, which resets the request count at the start of each time window, the Sliding Window Rate Limiter continuously tracks the request count within a moving time window.

Here's an explanation of the Sliding Window Rate Limiter algorithm:

## Initialization:

The rate limiter is initialized with two parameters:
maxRequests: The maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.
windowDuration: The duration of the time window during which requests are counted.
## Request Handling:

When a request arrives, the rate limiter checks the request count within the current time window.
If the request count is less than maxRequests, the request is allowed, and the request count is incremented.
If the request count has reached maxRequests, the request is denied, and an error response is returned.
## Sliding Time Window:

The rate limiter maintains a sliding time window of windowDuration. This window moves forward in time as new requests arrive.
## Request Count Tracking:

For each incoming request, the rate limiter checks the time window associated with the request's timestamp.
If the timestamp falls within the current time window, the request is counted toward the current window.
If the timestamp falls outside the current time window, it may be in a new window or an old one, depending on the timestamp.
## Expired Time Windows:

Time windows that have expired (i.e., moved entirely outside the tracking window) are discarded, and their request counts are removed from consideration.
## Rate Limit Enforcement:

The rate limiter enforces the rate limit by comparing the request count within the current time window to maxRequests.
## Key characteristics and considerations of the Sliding Window Rate Limiter:

- It enforces a rate limit by continuously tracking the request count within a moving time window.

- The sliding window approach allows for better handling of bursty traffic patterns compared to the fixed window approach.

- Requests that exceed the rate limit are denied, helping to prevent resource overload.

- The rate limiter must manage multiple time windows, each with its associated request count, which may increase memory usage.

- The choice of maxRequests and windowDuration should be based on the desired rate limiting behavior and the expected traffic patterns of your application.

- This algorithm provides more accurate rate limiting and can adapt to changing request patterns.

- When designing a Sliding Window Rate Limiter, consider how to efficiently manage and track multiple time windows, especially in scenarios with high request rates.
