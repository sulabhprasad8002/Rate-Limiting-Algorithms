## The Fixed Window Rate Limiter is a simple rate limiting algorithm that allows a fixed number of requests to be processed within a specific time window. If the number of incoming requests exceeds this limit within the time window, additional requests are either delayed or denied.

Here's an explanation of the Fixed Window Rate Limiter algorithm:

## Initialization:

The rate limiter is initialized with two parameters:
maxRequests: The maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.
windowDuration: The duration of the time window during which requests are counted.
## Request Handling:

When a request arrives, the rate limiter checks whether the current count of requests within the time window has reached maxRequests. If it has, the request is denied, and an error response is returned.
## Time Window Tracking:

The rate limiter maintains a sliding time window of windowDuration during which it keeps track of the number of requests. This window slides forward in time as new requests arrive.
Request Count Reset:

At the beginning of each time window, the count of requests is reset to zero, and the rate limiter starts counting requests for the new window.
Request Count Increment:

For each incoming request, the rate limiter increments the request count for the current time window.
## Rate Limit Check:

Before processing a new request, the rate limiter checks if the current request count exceeds maxRequests. If it does, the request is denied. Otherwise, the request is allowed, and the request count is incremented.
Delayed or Denied Requests:

If a request is denied due to exceeding the rate limit, the rate limiter may delay the request for a brief period before processing it. Alternatively, it can respond with an error indicating that the request was denied.
## Key characteristics and considerations of the Fixed Window Rate Limiter:

- It enforces a strict rate limit, allowing a fixed number of requests within each time window.

- Requests that exceed the rate limit are either delayed or denied, depending on the implementation.

- It may not handle bursts of requests well, as it strictly enforces the rate limit, even if there was a period of low or no activity in the previous time window.

- The algorithm is relatively simple to implement but may not be suitable for all rate limiting scenarios, particularly those with bursty traffic patterns.

- It's important to choose an appropriate maxRequests and windowDuration based on the desired rate limiting behavior and the expected traffic patterns of your application.

- When designing a Fixed Window Rate Limiter, consider how to handle requests that exceed the rate limit, whether they should be delayed and processed later or immediately denied with an error response.
